### User Stories

#### Filter Deals

As a user, I want to be able to filter deals by the day of the week so I can see what deals are available on a specific day
As a user, I want to be able to filter deals by category (food, drinks, shops) so I can narrow my search to specific types of deals.

#### View Deals

As a user, I want to be able to view a list of deals filtered by day and category so I can browse available offers
As a user, I want to see key details for each deal like title, description, location, so I can quickly determine if it interests me.

#### Save Deals

As a user, I want to be able to save/bookmark deals I'm interested in so I can easily access them later.

#### View Deal Details

As a user, I want to be able to click on a deal from the list to see more details like eligibility terms, fine print etc.

#### Mobile Friendly

As a user, I want the app interface to be mobile-friendly so I can use it on the go.

### Communication Plan

#### How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?

We will make note of any ideas we have on the weekend and after class time. Communication is only expected to happen from 9am until 4pm, weekdays. We will communicate any particular issues we have.

#### What is your strategy for ensuring everyone's voices are heard?

We are a fair group, and all of our opinions will be considered. To ensure this definitely happens, we will ensure people have time to discuss their progress in every stand up. Check in with group mates. Ensure we are collaborative in our planning.

#### How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?

Establish a clear communication plan. Address any potentially harmful behaviour consistently. Create a non-judgemental atmosphere, where everyone can share all ideas.

### Conflict Plan

#### What will your group do when it encounters conflict?

We will discuss any problems we have as a group, and avoid making it personal

#### How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?

One member of the group will have a private, constructive conversation. We will encourage open communication and seek the perspective of others.

#### What is your process to resolve conflicts?

We will identify the root cause of the conflict, and open dialogue to hear all perspectives. We will seek common ground and establish a plan to move forward.

#### How and when will you escalate the conflict if your attempts are unsuccessful?

Reassess the situation. Contact a TA.
