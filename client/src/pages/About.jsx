        <h2>Andy</h2>
        <p>
          39 and still not knowing what he wants to do with his life, Andy
          ditched his boring but safe job (as a Probation Officer) and embarked
          (hopefully) on a career in the tech industry. Born and raised in the
          gang-ridden suburbs of Rainhill, Andy spent most his adult life living
          in and around Liverpool City Centre, until being sucked back into the
          ghettos of L35. When he is not busy doing maths, fighting dragons, and
          refusing to pay full price for food, Andy has interests in music, TV
          geeking, travelling, football, and football shirt collecting.

          A Tech Educators boot camp student from Liverpool and member of SCAL
          (Susie, Cordelia, Andy and Luke). Alongside the course, Susie manages
          an escape room in Liverpool City Centre (You'd think this means that
          she is good at escape rooms. She's ✨not✨). Susie has absolutely
          loved working on her final project with this team and can't wait to
          find some good pub discounts on Dealio after the course!

        <h2>Luke</h2>
        <p>
          Luke was born and raised in Liverpool and used to work in healthcare
          but realised he enjoyed building things so decided on a move into
          Tech! His main motivation for a career change is to gain and improve
          on the logical thinking skills that it requires to be in this field.
          Luke says that in a world of misinformation, the ability to establish
          a mental framework for addressing questions correctly is very
          important, and thinks programming and logic can help him improve his
          critical thinking and approach to questions.
